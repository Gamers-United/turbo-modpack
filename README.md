# Turbo Skylands

This mod pack was made for a group of friends who were divided. Some of them wanted Adventure, Other's Technology. This pack aims to solve that problem by providing both a technically invigorating experience while also providing dungeons with 3 different dungeons mods, as well as the Skylands world type to make an adventure's dream mod pack.

 

At least 7GB of ram allocated to run this mod pack. Recommended 8GB+
