# Hi Fellow Contributor,

Please feel free to fix issues from the issue tracker, or make changes that you think would make sense in the context and theme of the modpack.

* Please be aware however, that any Curse revenue recieved from the pack's listing on curse will not be shared to any contributors on github,
unless they have been recognised as a contributor on Curse, thanks for your understanding here, as sharing the revenue to a large amount of people would be difficult. *
